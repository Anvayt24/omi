Diagram of where to attach the electrodes:

### Masseter (jaw):

Electrode near cheekbone â†’ CH1 upper (+).

Electrode nearer the jaw angle â†’ CH1 lower (â€“).

### Reference (REF):

Connect REF electrode to REF pin (separate on Ganglion header).

Place on neutral bony spot (forehead).

### Bias (GND):

Connect bias electrode to BIAS pin.

Hereâ€™s how to place them more precisely:

ðŸ”¹ Masseter (for CH1 & CH2)

Location: side of the face, between the cheekbone and the angle of the jaw.

How to find: put your fingers on the side of your jaw and clench your teeth â€” youâ€™ll feel the masseter bulge.

Placement:

CH1: just above the bulge (closer to cheekbone).

CH2: 2â€“3 cm below, along the same vertical line toward the jaw angle.

Tip: keep both on the thickest part of the muscle, aligned top-to-bottom.

ðŸ”¹ Chin/Lips (for CH3 & CH4)

You want to capture articulation when you mouth words:

Best target: mentalis muscle (center of chin, under lower lip). It activates when you press/purse lips.

Placement:

CH3: just below the lower lip, center of chin.

CH4: 2â€“3 cm further down along the midline of the chin.

Alternative: if you prefer lip edge signals, move slightly lateral under the corners of the mouth â€” but chin midline is cleaner.

ðŸ”¹ Recap

CH1/CH2: vertically stacked on the masseter, side of jaw.

CH3/CH4: vertically stacked on the chin (mentalis), below the lower lip.

REF: forehead (bony).

BIAS: mastoid (behind ear) or shoulder.
