# Re-enable Branch Protection Rules

## Changes
- Re-enable branch protection rules for the main branch
- Ensure "Do not allow bypassing the above settings" is enabled
- Require pull requests before merging

## Why
The branch protection rules were temporarily disabled to allow direct pushes to main. Now that the necessary changes are in place, we should re-enable these protections to maintain code quality and review process.

## Testing
- [ ] Branch protection rules are enabled
- [ ] Direct pushes to main are blocked
- [ ] Pull requests are required for all changes
- [ ] No bypass options are available
